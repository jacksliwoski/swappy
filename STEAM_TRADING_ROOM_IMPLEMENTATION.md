## üîß Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Offers stored as item IDs
const [myOffer, setMyOffer] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [theirOffer, setTheirOffer] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Ready states (independent booleans)
const [myReady, setMyReady] = useState(false);
const [theirReady, setTheirReady] = useState(false);

// Event log
const [events, setEvents] = useState<TradeEvent[]>([]);
```

### Readiness Reset Logic
```typescript
function clearReadiness() {
  if (myReady || theirReady) {
    setMyReady(false);
    setTheirReady(false);
    setShowOfferChangedNotice(true);
    addEvent('not_ready', 'Offer changed ‚Äî readiness cleared');
    setTimeout(() => setShowOfferChangedNotice(false), 3000);
  }
}
```

Called automatically whenever:
- Item added to any offer
- Item removed from any offer

### Drag & Drop Implementation
```typescript
// Draggable items
<ItemCard
  draggable={true}
  onDragStart={(e) => handleDragStart(item.id, 'mine')}
/>

// Drop zones
<div
  onDragOver={handleDragOver}
  onDrop={handleDropToMyOffer}
  style={{ border: draggedItem ? '3px dashed' : undefined }}
>
```
