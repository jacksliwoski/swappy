# Steam-Style Trading System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The trading system has been updated to match Steam's offer-based model where users can:
1. Select who they want to trade with
2. Curate a trade offer from both inventories
3. Send the offer which appears in the recipient's messages
4. Accept, decline, or counter trade offers

## Frontend Changes

### 1. TradeBuilder.tsx - User Selection & Trading Interface

**New Features:**
- **User Selector** at the top of the page with:
  - Search bar to filter users by username
  - List of available trading partners
  - Visual indicators for selected user
  - Confirmation message when a user is selected
  
- **Conditional Trade UI** - The trading interface only appears after selecting a user

- **Updated State Management:**
  ```typescript
  const [availableUsers, setAvailableUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
  const [selectedUserId, setSelectedUserId] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  ```

- **User Inventory Loading:**
  - Loads available users on component mount
  - Fetches selected user's inventory when a user is chosen
  - Clears offers when switching users

**Button Updates:**
- Changed "Confirm Trade" â†’ "Send Trade Offer" (desktop)
- Changed "Confirm" â†’ "Send Offer" (mobile)
- Prompts for optional message when sending offer

### 2. api.ts - Real Backend Integration

**Updated Trade API:**
```typescript
trades: {
  propose(trade: any) - POST /api/trades/propose
  accept(tradeId: string) - PUT /api/trades/:id/accept
  decline(tradeId: string) - PUT /api/trades/:id/decline
  counter(tradeId: string, counterOffer: any) - POST /api/trades/:id/counter
  getAll(userId: string) - GET /api/trades?userId={userId}
  get(tradeId: string) - GET /api/trades/:id
}
```

All methods now use `withAuth()` to include authentication headers.

### 3. Messages.tsx - Trade Offer Display

**Existing Features (already implemented):**
- Displays `TradeOfferCard` when a message contains a trade offer
- Action buttons for Accept, Decline, Counter
- Handlers for all trade actions
- Navigation to TradeBuilder for counter offers

### 4. TradeOfferCard.tsx

**Component displays:**
- Items from both sides of the trade
- Fairness rating
- Status indicators
- Action buttons (Accept, Decline, Counter) for the receiver

## Backend Changes

### visa-server/src/routes/trades.js

**New Endpoints Added:**

#### 1. POST `/api/trades/propose`
- Creates a new trade offer
- Stores in `store.tradeOffers` Map
- Creates a message notification with embedded trade
- Returns: `{ ok: true, tradeId, trade }`

#### 2. GET `/api/trades`
- Gets all trades for a user
- Query param: `userId`
- Returns: `{ ok: true, trades: [...] }`

#### 3. GET `/api/trades/:id`
- Gets a specific trade by ID
- Returns: `{ ok: true, trade }`

#### 4. PUT `/api/trades/:id/accept`
- Accepts a trade offer
- Updates status to 'accepted'
- Awards 50 XP to both users
- Creates acceptance message
- Returns: `{ ok: true, trade }`

#### 5. PUT `/api/trades/:id/decline`
- Declines a trade offer
- Updates status to 'declined'
- Creates decline message
- Returns: `{ ok: true, trade }`

#### 6. POST `/api/trades/:id/counter`
- Creates a counter offer
- Marks original as 'countered'
- Creates new trade with `counterOfferTo` reference
- Creates counter offer message
- Returns: `{ ok: true, tradeId, trade }`

**Data Storage:**
- Trade offers stored in `store.tradeOffers` Map
- Messages with embedded trades stored in `store.messages` Map
- All endpoints require authentication via `requireAuth` middleware

## User Flow

### Proposing a Trade:
1. User navigates to Trading Room
2. Searches for and selects a trading partner
3. Selected user's inventory loads automatically
4. User adds items from both inventories
5. System calculates fairness
6. User clicks "Send Trade Offer"
7. Prompted to add optional message
8. Offer is sent and appears in recipient's messages

### Receiving a Trade:
1. Recipient sees new message in Messages section
2. `TradeOfferCard` displays full trade details
3. Can see all items, fairness rating, and sender's message
4. Options:
   - **Accept**: Trade is completed, both users get XP
   - **Decline**: Trade is rejected
   - **Counter**: Navigate to TradeBuilder to create counter offer

### Counter Offers:
1. Click "Counter Offer" button
2. Redirected to Trading Room with `?counter={tradeId}` query param
3. Can adjust items and send new offer
4. Original offer marked as 'countered'
5. New offer sent as separate trade with reference to original

## Data Structure

### Trade Object:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  fromUserId: string;
  toUserId: string;
  fromUser: User;
  toUser: User;
  offerA: { items: InventoryItem[], totalValue: number };
  offerB: { items: InventoryItem[], totalValue: number };
  status: 'proposed' | 'accepted' | 'declined' | 'countered';
  fairness: FairnessResponse;
  proposedAt: string;
  respondedAt?: string;
  counterOfferTo?: string;
  message?: string;
}
```

### Message with Trade Offer:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  conversationId: string;
  fromUserId: string;
  toUserId: string;
  text: null;
  tradeOffer: {
    trade: Trade;
  };
  sentAt: string;
  read: boolean;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd visa-server
   npm start

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test User Selection:**
   - Navigate to Trading Room (ðŸ”„ icon)
   - Search for users in the selector
   - Click to select a user
   - Verify their inventory loads

3. **Test Trade Offer:**
   - Add items from both inventories
   - Click "Send Trade Offer"
   - Add optional message
   - Check browser console for API call

4. **Test Messages (future):**
   - Navigate to Messages
   - Look for trade offer message
   - Test Accept/Decline/Counter buttons

## Known Limitations

1. **User Discovery:** Currently uses mock users. In production, would fetch from `/api/users` endpoint.

2. **Message Loading:** Messages API is partially mocked. Trade offers will be stored in backend but message retrieval needs full implementation.

3. **Counter Offer UI:** The TradeBuilder doesn't yet pre-populate items when receiving `?counter=` query param. This can be added as an enhancement.

4. **Real-time Updates:** Trade status changes don't automatically update in open messages. Users need to refresh.

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Integration:** Real-time notifications when trade offers are received
2. **Trade History:** Dedicated page to view all past trades
3. **Trade Status Tracking:** Visual timeline showing trade progression
4. **Image Previews:** Better image display in TradeOfferCard
5. **Counter Offer Pre-population:** Load original trade items when countering
6. **User Avatars:** Fetch real user profile images
7. **Trade Filters:** Filter trades by status, user, date range
8. **Trade Analytics:** Stats on trade success rate, average fairness scores
